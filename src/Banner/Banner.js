             I am  a Software developer with a passion for
             creating intuitive and visually appealing user experiences. I have
             experience with a wide range of frontend technologies, including
             HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is skilled at using these tools to
             bring design mockups to life. I am a strong problem-solver and
